# Make-or-Buy Analysis for Bakery Equipment Parts

This project presents a cost-focused supply chain analysis to support a make-or-buy decision for parts used in bakery equipment maintenance. The goal is to evaluate the total cost implications of producing parts in-house versus purchasing them from external suppliers.

## Objective

To determine the most cost-effective sourcing strategy by analyzing:

* Recurring costs of part replacement
* Extended costs including logistics, overhead, and volume-based effects
* Comparative supplier costs and purchase volumes
* Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for both internal manufacturing and external procurement

## Approach

The analysis is built around cost modeling rather than quality or delivery time. It focuses on identifying which option — make or buy — results in lower long-term operational costs for a specialized bakery operation.

Key steps included:

* Cost breakdown for in-house production
* Cost breakdown per supplier
* Recurring cost patterns over time
* Volume sensitivity and impact on unit economics
* Scenario comparison and breakeven points

## Tools Used

* DAX
* Power BI
* Cost modeling and volume analysis techniques

## Key Outputs

* Visual comparison of internal vs external cost structures
* Volume vs unit cost simulation
* Supplier ranking based on recurring and extended costs
* Decision logic for optimal sourcing based on total cost

## Insights

* Certain high-volume parts had lower unit costs when outsourced
* Low-volume or irregular-use parts were more economical to produce internally
* Some suppliers had hidden extended costs affecting long-term profitability
* Cost drivers shifted significantly with volume changes

## How to Use

1. Open the Power BI dashboard provided in the repository
2. Use slicers and filters to& used alot of DAX to explore cost scenarios across different parts and volumes
3. Review the cost breakdown tables to support decision-making
